# Campus-Hire
Campus Hire is a  Hibernate-based web application designed to facilitate recruitment within an academic institution. It features three modules: Admin, Student, and Company. Admins manage job postings, regulate a discussion forum, and ensure only eligible students can view and apply for jobs. Students can apply to jobs, share their resumes with companies, and participate in the forum to discuss interview experiences. Companies receive student applications and manage recruitment through their accounts, making the platform a comprehensive solution for streamlined placement processes.
